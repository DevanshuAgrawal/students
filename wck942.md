My name is Sean Whalen. I'm an undergrad CS major graduating this December, after which I will pursue a master's degree in CS. My main hobby outside of computers is music - come see my band High Heat play in Knoxville! My favorite language is probably C. I have become interested in making stuff with webgl after taking the Graphics course.
